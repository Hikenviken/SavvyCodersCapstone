Max Eddy's Capstone Project.

The audience that my website will attract is other fellow keyboard enthusiasts, or to anyone that is interested in getting into keyboards and might possibly want to branch out to different switches then they are used to, or make their own Keyboard.

I want to create a website in which users can view and learn about different keyboard keyswitches. figure out with keyswitch is right for them with informative description and video use to give the users an understanding of which keyswitch they want. I will also provide links to where they can buy a full size keyboard of that switch as well as the key individually.

The reason I want to make with website is that Iâ€™ve always wanted an easier way to test different key switches without needing to constantly go from website to website from video to video, being able to access is all in a hub would save me and many others lots of time and frustration that comes with trying to figure out what key switch they want.
